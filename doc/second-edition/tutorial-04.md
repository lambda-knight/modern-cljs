## 序文

If you want to start working from the end of the [previous tutorial][4],
assuming you've [git][5] installed, do as follows.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/magomimmo/modern-cljs.git
cd modern-cljs
git checkout se-tutorial-03
```

## はじめに

As everybody knows, in the 1990s JS was primarily used for
improving and validating HTML forms. Then, in the second half of the
2000s, JS started to be used to make asynchronous requests to server-side
resources and within a few months we had two new buzzwords, Ajax
and Web 2.0.

As I said, I'm going to follow the already cited [Modern JavaScript][1]
book to try to translate [Larry Ullman's][2] approach into a kind of
Modern ClojureScript.

So let's start by migrating his first example to CLJS, a login form,
because it's very instructive both in explaining the evolution of the use
of JS in the latest decade, and in starting CLJS programming without
knowing much about Clojure and/or ClojureScript themselves.

## Registration form

If you downloaded the [Modern JS][3] code samples, you'll find `login.html`,
`css/styles.css` and `js/login.js` files in the `ch02` directory.

![Modern ch02 tree][6]

If you open `login.html` with your browser you should see something like
this:

![Login Form][7]

Now, let's take a look at the HTML.

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>Login</title>
    <!--[if lt IE 9]>
    <script src="http://html5shiv.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/html5.js"></script>
    <![endif]-->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/styles.css">
</head>
<body>
    <!-- login.html -->
    <form action="login.php" method="post" id="loginForm">
        <fieldset>
            <legend>Login</legend>

            <div>
              <label for="email">Email Address</label>
              <input type="email" name="email" id="email" required>

            </div>

            <div>
              <label for="password">Password</label>
              <input type="password" name="password" id="password"
              required>
            </div>

            <div>
              <label for="submit"></label>
              <input type="submit" value="Login &rarr;" id="submit">
            </div>

        </fieldset>
    </form>

    <script src="js/login.js"></script>

</body>
</html>
```
### Progressive enhancement and unobtrusive JS

Note that each element has both a `name` attribute and an `id`
attribute. The `name` value will be used when the form data is submitted
to the server-side. The `id` value will be used by JS/CSS.

The `login.php` script is associated with the `form action`. And
`login.js` is linked within the html page. Aside from `login.js`,
there is not any other direct connection between the `form` and the JS
script. This choice has to do with the so called *progressive
enhancement* and *unobtrusive JS* approaches that Larry Ullman clearly
explains in his book.

The following [sequence diagrams][8] show these approaches in action.

#### Server-side only validation

![Login Form Seq DIA 1][9]

The form submitted by the user will be validated by the server-side PHP
script named `login.php`. If the validation check passes, the server
will log in the user, otherwise the server will return the errors to
the user for correction.

Thanks to JS and Ajax, this user experience can be improved a lot. A
better solution is to perform a client-side validation using JS, which
brings us to the second sequence diagram.

#### Client-side validation

![Login Form Seq DIA 2][10]

If the client-side (i.e., JS) validation passes, we still have to ask
the server-side validation for security reasons. But if the
client-side validation does not pass, we do not need to make a
round-trip to the server and we can immediately return the errors to
the user.

But we still have a few problems. The client-side validation cannot
check if the username is registered. This bring us to Ajax and the
third sequence diagram.

#### Ajax in action

![login Form Seq DIA 3][11]

The user experience has now been much more enhanced. The Ajax call
communicates with the server (e.g., to verify if the email address
exists) resulting in a more efficient and responsive process.

In this tutorial, we are going to limit ourselves to the client-side
validation scenario without implementing the server-side validation or
the Ajax call to the server. We will implement those in subsequent,
more advanced tutorials.

## Porting to ClojureScript

It has not been a short trip, but we can now start to port the login
form validation from JS to CLJS. We're going to start off by directly
translating JS to CLJS using [CLJS interop][13] with the underlying
JavaScript Virtual Machine (JSVM).

### Copy the `login.html` file

First copy the `login.html` resource from the zip file you should have
downloaded from [here][3].

```bash
cd /path/to/modern-cljs
unzip ~/Downloads/modern_javascript_scripts.zip -d ~/Downloads/
cp ~/Downloads/modern_javascript_scripts/ch02/login.html html/index.html
```

By renaming the `login.html` to `index.html` into the `html`
sub-directory of the project home directory we're overwriting the
`index.html` file we created in [Tutorial-01][12].

Before going on you need to make two small changes to the copied
`html/index.html` file:

* deactivate the HTML5 check of the form fields by adding the
  `novalidate` attribute to the `<form>` tag;
* update the `src` attribute of the `<script>` tag from
  `"js/login.js"` to `"js/main.js"` to link the JS file generated by
  the CLJS compiler.

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
...
<body>
    <!-- Script 2.2 - login.html -->
    <form action="login.php" method="post" id="loginForm" novalidate>
    ...
    </form>
    <script src="js/main.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

### Launching the Immediate Feedback Development Environment (IFDE)

Considering the efforts we made in the previous three tutorials to
build a Development Environment approaching the Immediate Feedback
Principle, we'd like to see it at work while porting to CLJS the JS
code attached to the login form.

Start the IFDE as usual:

```bash
boot dev
Starting reload server on ws://localhost:57153
Writing boot_reload.cljs...
Writing boot_cljs_repl.cljs...
2015-11-15 18:46:58.893:INFO::clojure-agent-send-off-pool-0: Logging initialized @9965ms

Adding :require adzerk.boot-cljs-repl to main.cljs.edn...
Compiling ClojureScript...
• js/main.js
Writing target dir(s)...
Elapsed time: 17.874 sec
```

You can now visit the `http://localhost:3000` URL to get the login
form. As you see it does not find the CSS style linked to it. This is
because we did not copy the original `styles.css` into the project.

Let's see if our IFDE is able to manage the addition of the original
CSS style as follows:

```bash
# from a new terminal
cd /path/to/modern-cljs
mkdir html/css
cp ~/Downloads/modern_javascript_scripts/ch02/css/styles.css html/css/
```

As soon as you copy the `styles.css` file into the `html/css`
directory of the project, you'll see the IFDE loading it and the style
of the login form to be uploaded as well.

So far so good.

It's now time to start experimenting with CLJS at the bREPL by trying
to emulate the behavior of the original `login.js` code. Before we start
let's consider example validateForm() function:

```JS
// Script 2.3 - login.js

// Function called when the form is submitted.
// Function validates the form data and returns a Boolean value.
function validateForm() {
    'use strict';

    // Get references to the form elements:
    var email = document.getElementById('email');
    var password = document.getElementById('password');

    // Validate!
    if ( (email.value.length > 0) && (password.value.length > 0) ) {
        return true;
    } else {
        alert('Please complete the form!');
        return false;
    }

} // End of validateForm() function.
```

Here, the `validateForm()` function gets the `email` and the
`password` ids from the form input and verifies that both have values
(i.e. `length > 0`).

The `validateForm()` function returns `true` if the validation passes,
`false` otherwise.

I know, it's a very basic validation, but it's only a kind of
placeholder useful to demonstrate the approach.

### bREPLing with CLJS

Launch the bREPL as usual:

```clj
boot repl -c
REPL-y 0.3.7, nREPL 0.2.12
Clojure 1.7.0
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM 1.8.0_66-b17
        Exit: Control+D or (exit) or (quit)
    Commands: (user/help)

              (find-doc "part-of-name-here")

boot.user=> (start-repl)

```

We can now evaluate CLJS expressions at the bREPL, but we first need a
way to access the browser DOM.

```clj
cljs.user=> js/window
#object[Window [object Window]]
cljs.user=> js/document
#object[HTMLDocument [object HTMLDocument]]
cljs.user> js/console
#js {:debug #object[debug "function debug() {
    [native code]
}"], :error #object[error "function error() {
    [native code]
}"], :log #object[log "function log() {
    [native code]
}"],
...
     :groupEnd #object[groupEnd "function groupEnd() {
    [native code]
}"]}

```

As you see, when hosted by the JSVM of the browser, CLJS defines a
`js` special namespace to allow accessing JS objects defined in the
global space:

* `js/window`: representing the browser's window
* `js/document`: representing the document object (i.e. the DOM)
* `js/console`: representing the JS console of the browser

Being a guest programming language, CLJS can interoperate with the
underlying JS engine via special forms.

The `.` special form allows you to interoperate with the underlying JS
engine like so: `(object.function *args)`:

```clj
cljs.user> (js/console.log "Hello from ClojureScript!")
nil
```

> NOTE 2: The `Iceweasel` web browser throws an error message when
> console log is called from the bREPL but still outputs to the console.
> This error message does not occur when the bREPL connects to the
> `Chromium` web browser.

Here we called the `log` function on the `console` object living in
the `js` special namespace by passing to it the `"Hello from
ClojureScript!"` string as an argument. The `/` char keeps a namespace
name separated from the symbols defined in the namespace itself.

You should see the `Hello from ClojureScript!` message printed in the
JS console of your browser.

Let's now try to get the DOM elements of our login form using the same
`.` interoperable special form:

```clj
cljs.user> (js/document.getElementById "loginForm")
#object[HTMLFormElement [object HTMLFormElement]]
cljs.user> (js/document.getElementById "email")
#object[HTMLInputElement [object HTMLInputElement]]
cljs.user> (js/document.getElementById "password")
#object[HTMLInputElement [object HTMLInputElement]]
cljs.user> (js/document.getElementById "submit")
#object[HTMLInputElement [object HTMLInputElement]]
```

Not so bad, but CLJS syntax supports some syntactic sugar for the
previous interoperable scenario: `(.function +args)`. This syntactic
sugar form is considered more idiomatic by Clojarians because it does
not use the object as an implicit argument of the function. Let's try
it:

```clj
cljs.user> (.log js/console "Hello from ClojureScript!")
nil
```

Here we called the `log` function, passing it both the `console`
object and the `"Hello from ClojureScript!"` string as arguments.

You should see the `Hello from ClojureScript!` message printed again to
the JS console of the browser.

Now apply the above idiomatic interoperable form on the DOM elements
as well:

```clj
cljs.user> (.getElementById js/document "loginForm")
#object[HTMLFormElement [object HTMLFormElement]]
cljs.user> (.getElementById js/document "email")
#object[HTMLInputElement [object HTMLInputElement]]
cljs.user> (.getElementById js/document "password")
#object[HTMLInputElement [object HTMLInputElement]]
cljs.user> (.getElementById js/document "submit")
#object[HTMLInputElement [object HTMLInputElement]]
```

To resemble the original JS code we also need to access the `value`
property of the `email` and `password` elements. CLJS offers the `.-`
special form for these cases as well: `(.-property object)`:

```clj
cljs.user> (.-value (.getElementById js/document "email"))
""
cljs.user> (.-value (.getElementById js/document "password"))
""
```

As you see the two calls both return the void string `""`. Now fill in
both the `email` and `password` fields in the login form and evaluate
again the above expressions:

```clj
cljs.user> (.-value (.getElementById js/document "email"))
"you@yourdomain.com"
cljs.user> (.-value (.getElementById js/document "password"))
"bjSgwMd24J"
```

We still need other things. We need a way to set a value for a DOM
element. Again, CLJS offers a way to do that via the `(set! (.-property
object) arg)` form. Let's try to set the `value` property of the
`password` element and then get it back:

```clj
cljs.user> (set! (.-value (.getElementById js/document "password"))
                 "weakpassword")
"weakpassword"
cljs.user> (.-value (.getElementById js/document "password"))
"weakpassword"
```

> NOTE 3: in CLJ/CLJS when a function changes the state of a mutable
> object, it is idiomatic to append the `!` char to it. This happens
> very frequently in interoperable scenarios with the underlining
> hosting platforms (i.e. JVM, JSVM and CLR at the moment).

Lastly, we need a function for counting the length of a string. The
`count` function works on any kind of collection and on strings as
well:

```clj
cljs.user> (count (.-value (.getElementById js/document "email")))
18
cljs.user> (count (.-value (.getElementById js/document "password")))
12
```

So far so good.

### Define the `validate-form` function

Now that we have done a few experiments in the bREPL on the interoperability
between CLJS and JS, we should be able to define a `validate-form`
CLJS function cloning the corresponding JS `validateForm` behavior.

Create a new CLJS file named `login.cljs` in the
`src/cljs/modern_cljs` directory which already hosts the `core.cljs`
source created in the [Tutorial-01][12]. Copy the following content
into it:

```clj
(ns modern-cljs.login)

;; define the function to be attached to form submission event
(defn validate-form []
  ;; get email and password element from their ids in the HTML form
  (let [email (.getElementById js/document "email")
        password (.getElementById js/document "password")]
    (if (and (> (count (.-value email)) 0)
             (> (count (.-value password)) 0))
      true
      (do (js/alert "Please, complete the form!")
          false))))
```

> NOTE 4: Note that in CLJ/CLJS the use of CamelCase to name things is
> not idiomatic. That's why we translated `validateForm` to
> `validate-form`.

Every CLJS file needs to define a namespace. Here we create the
`modern-cljs.login` namespace in which we defined the `validate-form`
function with the `defn` macro.

Inside the `validate-form` definition we used the `let` form to define
a kind of local variable, like `var` in the corresponding JS code. We
used the "."  and ".-" JS interoperable forms to call JS native
functions (i.e.  `.getElementById`) and to get/set JS object
properties (i.e.  `.-value`).

If you're curious about `defn`, `>`, `if`, `and` and `let` forms, just ask
for the internal documentation from the bREPL as follows:

```clj
cljs.user> (doc defn)
-------------------------
cljs.core/defn
([name doc-string? attr-map? [params*] prepost-map? body] [name doc-string? attr-map? ([params*] prepost-map? body) + attr-map?])
Macro
  Same as (def name (core/fn [params* ] exprs*)) or (def
    name (core/fn ([params* ] exprs*)+)) with any doc-string or attrs added
    to the var metadata. prepost-map defines a map with optional keys
    :pre and :post that contain collections of pre or post conditions.
nil
cljs.user> (doc >)
-------------------------
cljs.core/>
([x] [x y] [x y & more])
  Returns non-nil if nums are in monotonically decreasing order,
  otherwise false.
nil
cljs.user> (doc if)
-------------------------
if
   (if test then else?)
Special Form
  Evaluates test. If not the singular values nil or false,
  evaluates and yields then, otherwise, evaluates and yields else. If
  else is not supplied it defaults to nil.

  Please see http://clojure.org/special_forms#if
nil
cljs.user> (doc and)
-------------------------
cljs.core/and
([] [x] [x & next])
Macro
  Evaluates exprs one at a time, from left to right. If a form
  returns logical false (nil or false), and returns that value and
  doesn't evaluate any of the other expressions, otherwise it returns
  the value of the last expr. (and) returns true.
nil
cljs.user> (doc let)
-------------------------
cljs.core/let
([bindings & body])
Macro
  binding => binding-form init-expr

  Evaluates the exprs in a lexical context in which the symbols in
  the binding-forms are bound to their respective init-exprs or parts
  therein.
nil
```

Pretty handy. As you see `defn`, `and` and `let` forms are macro
expressions, while `>` is a regular function and finally `if` is a
special form. In the first position of a list expression you'll always
find one of those three forms, unless the list expression is quoted
with the `quote` special form which stands for preventing the form
evaluation. I don't know about you, but after many decades I've
yet to see a programming language with a syntax easier to
remember than a LISP, regardless of dialect.

You can even ask at the bREPL for the source code definitions of
symbols which are defined as macros or regular functions.

```clj
cljs.user> (source let)
(core/defmacro let
  "binding => binding-form init-expr

  Evaluates the exprs in a lexical context in which the symbols in
  the binding-forms are bound to their respective init-exprs or parts
  therein."
  [bindings & body]
  (assert-args let
     (vector? bindings) "a vector for its binding"
     (even? (count bindings)) "an even number of forms in binding vector")
  `(let* ~(destructure bindings) ~@body))
nil
cljs.user> (source >)
(defn ^boolean >
  "Returns non-nil if nums are in monotonically decreasing order,
  otherwise false."
  ([x] true)
  ([x y] (cljs.core/> x y))
  ([x y & more]
   (if (cljs.core/> x y)
     (if (next more)
       (recur y (first more) (next more))
       (cljs.core/> y (first more)))
     false)))
nil
```

All that said, as soon as you save the above file, the IFDE recompiles
it and reloads the `index.html` file that links it. But we still have
to modify the `html/js/main.cljs.edn` to inform our IFDE that we added
a new CLJS namespace.

### Update the `main.cljs.edn` file

Edit the `html/js/main.cljs.edn` file to add the `modern-cljs.login`
newly created namespace as follows:

```clj
{:require [modern-cljs.core modern-cljs.login]
 :compiler-options {:asset-path "js/main.out"}}
```

As soon as you save the change, the IFDE triggers the CLJS
recompilation and reloads the `index.html` file linking the
`js/main.js` generated file.

### bREPLing again

We can now verify if our `validate-form` function works as
expected. Go back to your bREPL and require the newly created
`modern-cljs.login` namespace as follows:

```clj
cljs.user> (require '[modern-cljs.login :as l] :reload)
nil
```

Here we required the `modern-cljs.login` namespace by aliasing it as
`l` into the current special `cljs.user` default namespace. The
`:reload` option forces loading of the `modern-cljs.login` namespace
even if it is already loaded.

First take a look at the value associated with the `l/validate-form`
symbol.


```clj
cljs.user> l/validate-form
#object[modern_cljs$login$validate_form "function modern_cljs$login$validate_form(){
var email = document.getElementById("email");
var password = document.getElementById("password");
if(((cljs.core.count.call(null,email.value) > (0))) && ((cljs.core.count.call(null,password.value) > (0)))){
return true;
} else {
alert("Please, complete the form!");

return false;
}
}"]
```

As you see the CLJS compiler translated the original CLJS code into
corresponding JS code. Even if the `source-map` compiler option allows
you to debug your CLJS code in the Developer Tools of your browser, the
understanding of the CLJS to JS translation could be very effective in
identifying and solving bugs in your code.

Obviously you can still see the CLJS `validate-form` definition by
using the `source` macro:

```clj
cljs.user> (source l/validate-form)
(defn validate-form []
  ;; get email and password element from their ids in the HTML form
  (let [email (.getElementById js/document "email")
        password (.getElementById js/document "password")]
    (if (and (> (count (.-value email)) 0)
             (> (count (.-value password)) 0))
      true
      (do (js/alert "Please, complete the form!")
          false))))
nil
```

Enough side talks. Let's now delete any value from the `email` and the
`password` fields and call the `validate-form` function.

```clj
cljs.user> (set! (.-value (.getElementById js/document "email")) "")
""
cljs.user> (set! (.-value (.getElementById js/document "password")) "")
""
cljs.user> (l/validate-form)
false
```

The call to `validate-form` opens the Alert Dialog and as soon as you
click the ok button, it will return `false` to the bREPL.

Now fill the above fields with some values and call the
`validate-form` function again.

```clj
cljs.user> (set! (.-value (.getElementById js/document "email")) "you@yourdomain.com")
"you@yourdomain.com"
cljs.user> (set! (.-value (.getElementById js/document "password")) "weakpassword")
"weakpassword"
cljs.user> (l/validate-form)
true
```

As expected, this time the `validate-form` function call will
immediately return `true`.

### Port the `init` function

After a little bit of bREPLing to get familiarized with some stuff, we were
able to define a CLJS function resembling the corresponding JS
`validateForm` function. But we still have to attach it to the
`submit` button of the login form when the `index.html` page is loaded
into the browser.

Here is the original JS code:

```js
// Function called when the window has been loaded.
// Function needs to add an event listener to the form.
function init() {
    'use strict';

    // Confirm that document.getElementById() can be used:
    if (document && document.getElementById) {
        var loginForm = document.getElementById('loginForm');
        loginForm.onsubmit = validateForm;
    }

} // End of init() function.

// Assign an event listener to the window's load event:
window.onload = init;
```

Open the `login.cljs` file again and add the `init` function at the
end as follows:

```clj
;; define the function to attach validate-form to onsubmit event of
;; the form
(defn init []
  ;; verify that js/document exists and that it has a getElementById
  ;; property
  (if (and js/document
           (.-getElementById js/document))
    ;; get loginForm by element id and set its onsubmit property to
    ;; our validate-form function
    (let [login-form (.getElementById js/document "loginForm")]
      (set! (.-onsubmit login-form) validate-form))))
```

As in the corresponding JS code, here we have associated the
`validate-form` function to the `onsubmit` property of the
`login-form`.

There is one last thing to be done to complete the porting of the
original JS code: we have to associate the `init` function with the
`onload` property of the `window` object.

Add the following code at the end of the `login.cljs` file.

```clj
;; initialize the HTML page in unobtrusive way
(set! (.-onload js/window) init)
```

As soon as you save the `login.cljs` everything is recompiled. But
this time you have to reload the Login Page because we attached the
`init` function to the `onload` event.

You can now safely play with the Login form from the browser itself:

* if you click the `Login` button before having filled both the
`email` and the `password` fields, you should see the alert dialog
popping up and asking you to complete the form;
* if you click the `Login` button after having filled both the `email`
and the `password` fields you should see the browser error page saying
that the page `localhost:3000/login.php` was not found. That's because the
action attribute of the html form still references `login.php` as the
server-side validation script. The server-side validation will be
implemented in CLJ in a subsequent tutorial.

Have you noted that we never had to stop/restart the IFDE during the
porting of the login form validation from JS to CLJS?

That's it for this tutorial and you can kill any `boot` related
process and reset your git repository.

```bash
git reset --hard
```

# Next Step [Tutorial 5: Introducing Domina][17]

In the [next tutorial][17] we're going to use the domina library to make our
login form validation more Clojure-ish.
